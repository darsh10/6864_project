macbook air and macbook pro computers come with lithium polymer batteries to provide maximum battery life in a compact space in order to fully understand battery technology and battery life its good to know common battery terminology cycle count batteries are expected to function for a certain number of cycles this number represents the sum of total and partial discharge cycles throughout the life of the battery you can see the cycle count limit for your computer by reviewing determining battery cycle count for mac notebooks full charge capacity measured in mah milliamperehours this refers to the amount of power the battery is capable of containing less the energy required to shut down the device this number lowers as the battery becomes depleted with usage and age remaining charge capacity this number represents the current amount of power left in the battery as measured in mah milliamperehours using the computer when not connected to ac power will cause this number to lower as power is depleted from the battery consumed depleted consumable parts are those that deplete over time as their internal components are used batteries due to their chemical components are considered consumables and slowly over time they lose their ability to hold a charge if the cycle count on a battery exceeds its expected limit the battery is considered consumed defective batteries are considered defective when they stop working due to a defect in materials or workmanship or due to a manufacturing defect defective batteries are covered under apples oneyear limited warranty and extendedservice contracts runtime the length of time a battery will power a computer battery runtime depends on the amount of power being consumed the runtime is affected by the full charge capacity and cycle count of a battery as well as the load put on the system the battery is powering load the amount of activity being performed by a task or tasks certain powerintensive processes place a heavier load on the battery and result in a muchreduced runtime per charge the battery status menuyour primary resource for viewing battery status is the battery status menu the battery status menu

HT201577	airport express frequently asked questions faq get answers to frequently asked questions about airport express here are some frequently asked questions and answers about airport express including questions about networking airplay printing and other hardware features general questionswhat is an airport express an airport express is a wifi base station besides acting as an internet access point it has several specialized features which make it ideal for specific needs airplay airplay allows you to wirelessly stream music to your entertainment system network printer airport express can act as a wireless interface for a printer connected to the usb port making it available to your entire network wifi airport express can act as a single wifi interface to any computer or almost any other device such as a game console that has an ethernet port but doesnt have builtin wifi wireless range airport express can be used to extend the wireless range of your existing wifi base station why should i keep applications like itunes and airport express firmware up to date to take advantage of all of the features supported by your airport express it is best to keep itunes and your wifi base station firmware up to date updates often include performance and bug fixes what do i need to do to add my game consoles or digital video recorder to my wifi network via airport express the device must have an ethernet port to connect the airport express to and needs to be configured correctly note you cannot do this if your airport express 80211g is in client mode as the ethernet port will be disabled what is the difference between airport express 80211g and airport express 80211n 1st generation airport express 80211g supports legacy wds wireless distribution system only while the airport express 80211gn can be added to an 80211n extended wifi network what is the difference between airport express 80211n 1st generation and airport express 80211n 2nd generation airport express 80211n 2nd generation has two ethernet ports a wan port and a lan port and supports simultaneous dualband 80211n ie it is a simultaneous dual band access point it also has a power cable since airport express 1st generation only has one ethernet port does it act as a lan port wan port or both depending on how you have it set up the ethernet port can function as a lan port defined as either simple bridging or sharing your internet connection via network address translation or a wan port connecting to your broadband internet service provider or upstream router however it never acts as both simultaneously by default the airport express ethernet port acts as a wan port when it is set up as a secondary extended wifi base station it can act as a lan port assuming that your internet service provider only gives you one ip address the most common scenario for homes this means that airport express can only accommodate wired clients when acting as an extender or bridge therefore if you need to support wired clients and only want to get one base station or router as its the routing capacity of airport express that is relevant here you should get the airport extreme base station or time capsule instead what is client mode essentially it means that the airport express becomes an interface for itunes to wirelessly deliver music to your entertainment center the ethernet port will be disabled and you will not be able to wirelessly connect other computers to the airport express for the purpose of internet access for more information see this article airport express what is client mode where can i learn more about setting up airport networks from the airport support page airplay questionsquestion how do i select between analog and digital audio out answer the 18 inch connector of the airport express will accept a standard stereo cable or a toslink connector when listening to my music through the airport express the sound cuts out intermittently how can i fix it the answer

next to my home theater and stream itunes to it can airport express join the thirdparty network yes airport express can join a thirdparty network in client mode or if it is connected via ethernet to a lan port on the nonapple wireless access point can itunes send a single airplay stream to multiple airport express stations yes you can send an airplay stream to multiple remote airport express units the maximum number of remote airport express units is up to six the actual number that will work in your environment will depend on conditions such as building composition and radio interference distance to the remote airport express units and available network capacity relative to your other usage can itunes send different airplay streams to different airport express stations no itunes only sends the same stream to multiple airport express units can my airplay stream play through my computers speakers at the same time yes you can play through both the computer speakers and multiple remote airport express units can i use other applications like quicktime or windows media player to send sound to airport express via airplay no question how can i use the usb port on my airport express answer you can connect one printer or a remote control to learn more see uses for the usb port of time capsule airport extreme airport express question a computer connects via ethernet to an existing wireless access pointrouter can this wired client send an airplay stream to airport express via the existing router answer yes if they are on the same subnet these are common examples of when it would work the existing router is an airport extreme base station 80211g set up as wds main with the airport express 80211g set up as wds remote the router is a wifi base station 80211gn set up as the primary extended base station and the airport express 80211n is set up as extended the airport express has joined the network airport or thirdparty in client mode you have a wiredonly router

as well known industry standard ports ports used by apple productsthe table below outlines tcp and udp ports used by apple products your network administrator might need this information to make sure your computer or device can connect to services like automatic software updates or the app store to learn what a tcp or udp port is see the ip ports section of os x what is a port not all ports and services listed are used by all software products some apps require more than one port network administrators might also want to use portwatching software in addition to the information in this article when making decisions about how to set up firewalls or similar access control schemes note that mac os x v105 and later include an application firewall which is different than a portbased firewall this article is updated periodically and contains information that is available at time of publication this document is intended as a quick reference and should not be regarded as comprehensive apple products listed in the table are the most commonly used examples not a comprehensive list the service or protocol name column lists services registered with the internet assigned numbers authority except where noted as unregistered use the names of apple products that use these services or protocols appear in the used by additional information column the rfc column lists the number of the request for comment document that defines the particular service or protocol which may be used for reference rfc documents are maintained by rfc editor if multiple rfcs define a protocol there may only be one listed here some services might use two or more ports if you find an instance of a product in this list search on the name commandf and then repeat your search commandg to locate all occurrences of the product for example vpn service can use up to four different ports 500 1701 1723 and 4500 some firewalls allow selective configuration of udp or tcp ports with the same number so it can be important to note which type of port youre configuring for example nfs can use either or both tcp 2049 and udp 2049 ports if your firewall doesnt allow you to specify making changes to one port probably affects the other the output of terminal commands can replace the port number with the label listed in etcservices refer to the service name column of the table to see what the

HT204587	about touch id security on iphone and ipad learn about touch id advanced technology and security benefits much of our digital lives is stored on our iphone and ipad and everyone should use a passcode to help protect this important information and their privacy unfortunately many smartphone users dont use a passcode touch id is a seamless way to use your fingerprint as a passcode your fingerprint is one of the best passcodes in the world its always with you and no two are exactly alike with just a touch of your devices home button the touch id sensor quickly reads your fingerprint and automatically unlocks your phone you can even use it to authorize purchases from the itunes store app store and ibooks store and apple pay advanced technologiesthe technology within touch id is some of the most advanced hardware and software weve put in any device the button is made from sapphire crystalone of the clearest hardest materials available this protects the sensor and acts as a lens to precisely focus it on your finger the steel ring surrounding the button detects your finger and tells touch id to start reading your fingerprint the sensor uses advanced capacitive touch to take a highresolution image from small sections of your fingerprint from the subepidermal layers of your skin touch id then intelligently analyzes this information with a remarkable degree of detail and precision it categorizes your fingerprint as one of three basic typesarch loop or whorl it also maps out individual details in the ridges that are smaller than the human eye can see and even inspects minor variations in ridge direction caused by pores and edge structures touch id can even read multiple fingerprints and it can read fingerprints in 360degrees of orientation it then creates a mathematical representation of your fingerprint and compares this to your enrolled fingerprint data to identify a match and unlock your device touch id will incrementally add new sections of your fingerprint to your enrolled fingerprint data to improve matching accuracy over time touch id uses all of this to provide an accurate match and a very high level of security security safeguardsevery fingerprint is unique so it is rare that even a small section of two separate fingerprints are alike enough to register as a match for touch id the probability of this happening is 1 in 50000 for one enrolled finger this is much better than the 1 in 10000 odds of guessing a typical 4digit passcode although some passcodes like 1234 may be more easily guessed there is no such thing as an easily guessable fingerprint pattern instead the 1 in 50000 probability means it requires trying up to 50000 different fingerprints until potentially finding a random match but touch id only allows five unsuccessful fingerprint match attempts before you must enter your passcode and you cant proceed until doing so to configure touch id you must first set up a passcode touch id is designed to minimize the input of your passcode but your passcode will be needed for additional security validation after restarting your device when more than 48 hours have elapsed from the last time you unlocked your device to enter the touch id passcode setting since security is only as secure as its weakest point you can choose to increase the security of a 4 or 6digit passcode by using a complex alphanumeric passcode you can do this when creating a passcode by tapping passcode options and selecting custom alphanumeric code you can also use touch id instead of entering your apple id password to purchase content from the itunes store app store and ibooks store you will be asked to scan your fingerprint with each purchase if touch id doesnt recognize your finger youll be asked to try again after five failed attempts youll be given the option of entering your apple id password in addition you will need to enter your apple id password after restarting your device enrolling or deleting fingers if your device is lost or stolen you can immediately disable touch id from being used to unlock your device with find my iphone lost mode ios 7 or later offers additional protection against theft with activation lock which requires an apple id and password to turn off find my iphone erase data or reactivate your device secure enclavetouch id doesnt store any images of your fingerprint it stores only a mathematical representation of your fingerprint it isnt possible for someone to reverse engineer your actual fingerprint image from this mathematical representation the chip in your device also includes an advanced security architecture called the secure enclave which was developed to protect passcode and fingerprint data fingerprint data is encrypted and protected with a key available only to the secure enclave fingerprint data is used only by the secure enclave to verify that your fingerprint matches the enrolled fingerprint data the secure enclave is walled off from the rest of the chip and the rest of ios therefore ios and other apps never access your fingerprint data its never stored on apple servers and its never backed up to icloud or anywhere else only touch id uses it and it cant be used to match against other fingerprint databases learn moreto learn more about ios security read the security configuration guides learn more about privacy and location services nov 3

HT202068	recommended settings for wifi routers and access points these wifi router or wifi base station settings are for all macs and ios devices these settings will give you the best performance security and reliability when using wifi this article is for network administrators and others who manage their own network if youre trying to join a wifi network one of these articles should help mac connect to the internet and check for wifi issues iphone ipad ipod touch join a wifi network and resolve wifi issues follow these steps firstbefore you change your settings follow these steps make sure that your wifi routers firmware is up to date for airport time capsule airport extreme or airport express base station check for the latest firmware using airport utility make sure that your wifi devices support the settings this article recommends if possible back up your wifi routers settings forget or remove the wifi settings for your network from any devices that connect to your wifi router this will prevent the devices from attempting to connect to your network with the old configuration youll need to reconnect these devices to your network when youre done applying the new settings configure all wifi routers on the same network with the same settings otherwise devices could have difficulty connecting to your network or your network could become unreliable if youre using a dualband wifi router configure both bands to have the same settings unless otherwise noted below ssid or wifi network namethe ssid service set identifier or network name identifies your wifi network to users and other wifi devices it is case sensitive set to any unique name choose a name thats unique to your network and isnt shared by other nearby networks or networks youre likely to encounter if your router came with a default ssid its especially important that you change it to a different unique name some common default ssid names to avoid are linksys netgear dlink wireless 2wire and default if your ssid isnt unique wifi devices will have trouble identifying your network this could cause them to fail to automatically connect to your network or to connect to other networks that share the same ssid it might also prevent wifi devices from using all routers in your network or prevent them from using all available bands of a router hidden networkhidden networks dont broadcast their ssid over wifi this option might be incorrectly referred to as a closed network and the corresponding nonhidden state might be referred to as broadcast or open set to disabled because hidden networks dont broadcast their ssid devices might need more time to find them and connect to them and connecting to them automatically might not always succeed hiding a network doesnt secure your wifi network because the ssid is still available in other ways mac address authentication or filteringrestricts access to a wifi router to devices with specific mac media access control addresses set to disabled when enabled this feature allows a user to configure a list of mac addresses for the wifi router and restrict access to devices with addresses that are on the list devices with mac addresses not on the list will fail to associate with the wifi network mac addresses can be changed easily so dont rely on them to prevent unauthorized access to the network ios 8 and later uses a randomized mac address when running wifi scans the scans are conducted when a device isnt associated with a wifi network and its processor is asleep a devices processor goes to sleep shortly after the screen is turned off wifi scans are run to determine if a user can connect to a preferred wifi network enhanced wifi scans are run when a device uses location services for apps that use geofencing such as locationbased reminders that determine if the device is near a specific location securitythe security setting controls the type of authentication and encryption used by your wifi router which allows you to control access to the network and specify the level of privacy for data you send over the air set to wpa2 personal aes wpa2 personal aes is currently the strongest form of security offered by wifi products and is recommended for all uses when enabling wpa2 be sure to select a strong password that cant be guessed by third parties if you have older wifi devices that dont support wpa2 personal aes a good second choice is wpawpa2 mode also known as wpa mixed mode this mode allows newer devices to use the stronger wpa2 aes encryption while still allowing older devices to connect with older wpa tkiplevel encryption if your wifi router doesnt support wpawpa2 mode wpa personal tkip mode is the next best choice for compatibility reliability performance and security reasons wep is not recommended wep is insecure and functionally obsolete if you must choose between wep and tkip choose tkip due to serious security weaknesses the wep and wpa tkip encryption methods are deprecated and strongly discouraged use these modes only if necessary to support legacy wifi devices that dont support wpa2 aes and cant be upgraded to support wpa2 aes devices using these deprecated encryption methods cant take full advantage of 80211n performance and other features as a result the wifi alliance has directed the wifi industry to phase out wep and wpa tkip if your security is set to none or unsecured mode youre using no authentication or encryption anyone can join your wifi network use your internet connection access any shared resource on your network and read any traffic you send over the network using an unsecured network is not recommended 24 ghz radio modethis setting controls which versions of the 80211abgn standard the network uses for wireless communication on the 24 ghz band newer standards 80211n support faster transfer rates and older standards provide compatibility with older devices and additional range set to 80211bgn routers that support 80211n should be configured for 80211bgn for maximum speed and compatibility routers that support only 80211g should be put in 80211bg mode routers that that support only 80211b can be left in 80211b mode different wifi routers support different radio modes so the setting varies depending on the router in general enable support for all modes devices can then automatically select the fastest commonly supported mode to communicate choosing a subset of the available modes prevents some devices from connecting for example 80211bg devices cant connect to a wifi router in 80211nonly mode also choosing a subset of the available modes might cause interference with nearby legacy networks and nearby legacy devices might interfere with your network 5 ghz radio modethis setting controls which versions of the 80211abgn standard the network uses for wireless communication on the 5 ghz band newer standards support faster transfer rates and older standards provide compatibility with older devices and additional range set to 80211an routers that support 80211n should be configured for 80211an mode for maximum speed and compatibility routers that support only 80211a can be left in 80211a mode different wifi routers support different radio modes so the setting varies depending on the router in general enable support for all modes devices can then automatically select the fastest commonly supported mode to

available modes might cause interference with nearby legacy networks and nearby legacy devices might interfere with your network channelthis setting controls which channel your wifi router uses to communicate set to auto for best performance choose auto mode and let the wifi router select the best channel if this mode isnt supported by your wifi router choose a channel thats free from other wifi routers and other sources of interference read about possible sources of interference 24 ghz channel widthchannel width controls how large of a pipe is available to transfer data however larger channels are more subject to interference and more likely to interfere with other devices a 40 mhz channel is sometimes called a wide channel and a 20 mhz channel is a narrow channel set to 20 mhz use 20 mhz channels in the 24 ghz band using 40 mhz channels in the 24 ghz band can cause performance and reliability issues with your network especially in the presence of other wifi networks and other 24 ghz devices a 40 mhz channel might also cause interference and issues with other devices that use this band such as bluetooth devices cordless phones and neighboring wifi networks routers that dont support 40 mhz channels in the 24 ghz band do support 20 mhz channels 5 ghz channel widthchannel width controls how large of a pipe is available to transfer data larger channels are more susceptible to interference and more likely to interfere with other devices interference is less of an issue in the 5 ghz band than in the 24 ghz band a 40 mhz channel is sometimes called a wide channel and a 20 mhz channel is a narrow channel set to for 80211n access points set the 5ghz band to 20 mhz and 40 mhz for 80211ac access points set the 5ghz band to 20 mhz 40 mhz and 80 mhz for best performance and reliability enable support for all channel widths this allows devices to use the largest width they support which results in optimal performance and compatibility not all client devices support 40 mhz channels so dont enable 40 mhzonly mode devices that support only 20 mhz channels cant connect to a wifi router in 40 mhzonly mode similarly dont enable 80 mhzonly mode or only clients capable of 80211ac will be able to connect routers that dont support 40 mhz or 80 mhz channels do support 20 mhz channels dhcpthe dynamic host configuration protocol dhcp assigns addresses that identify devices on your network once assigned devices use these addresses to communicate with each other and with computers on the internet the functionality of a dhcp server can be thought of as similar to a phone company handing out phone numbers which customers then use to call other people set to enabled if its the only dhcp server on your network there should be only one dhcp server on your network this dhcp server might be built in to your cable modem dsl modem or router if more than one device has dhcp enabled you will likely see address conflicts and have issues accessing the internet or other resources on your network natnetwork address translation nat translates between addresses on the internet and those on a local network the functionality of a nat provider is like that of a worker in

green memory resources are available yellow memory resources are still available but are being tasked by memorymanagement processes such as compression red memory resources are depleted and macos is using your startup drive for memory to make more ram available you can quit one or more apps or install more ram this is the most important indicator that your mac may need more ram physical memory the amount of ram installed in your mac memory used the total amount of memory currently used by all apps and macos processes app memory the total amount of memory currently used by apps and their processes wired memory memory that cant be compressed or paged out to your startup drive so it must stay in ram the wired memory used by a process cant be borrowed by other processes the amount of wired memory used by an app is determined by the apps programmer compressed the amount of memory in ram that is compressed to make more ram memory available to other processes look in the compressed mem column to see the amount of memory compressed for each process swap used the space used on your startup drive by macos memory management its normal to see some activity here as long as memory pressure is not in the red state macos has memory resources available cached files memory that was recently used by apps and is now available for use by other apps for example if youve been using mail and then quit mail the ram that mail was using becomes part of the memory used by cached files which then becomes available to other apps if you open mail again before its cachedfiles memory is used overwritten by another app mail opens more quickly because that memory is quickly converted back to app memory without having to load its contents from your startup drive for more information about memory management refer to the apple developer website energythe energy pane shows overall energy use and the energy used by each app energy impact a relative measure of the current energy consumption of the app lower numbers are better a triangle to the left of an apps name means that the app consists of multiple processes click the triangle to see details about each process avg energy impact the

HT2090	how to troubleshoot isight before you submit your camera for service try the steps below to identify and resolve issues with your isight camera important follow these instructions in order test the camera between steps to see if the issue is resolved builtin isight cameras these steps are for isight cameras that are built into a computer such as the imac g5 isight or later the macbook or macbook pro see if the issue is applicationspecific try another application isight works with applications like ichat photobooth and imovie hd 6 to see if the isight camera exhibits the same behavior in all applications if it only happens in one application try reinstalling that application see if the issue is userspecific test your isight camera in another user account if the issue only occurs in one user the issue would be isolated to user settings find out if the computer recognizes the isight check system profiler in the utilities folder inside the applications folder under the usb header check to see if the isight camera is detected reset smc or pmu reset your computers smc or pmu and then check system profiler again smc reset instructions for imac g5 isight intelbased imacs pmu reset instructions for macbook and macbook pro if your builtin isight camera is still not behaving correctly after trying all these steps you may need to contact apple or an appleauthorized service provider for service standalone isight cameras the instructions in this section apply if you have an isight camera that is not built into your computer but attaches to the computer via a firewire cable make sure the cable is completely plugged in incomplete cable connections are the most common cause of hardware problems follow these quick instructions to make sure your isight cable is completely plugged in turn the computer and the camera off unplug the firewire cable from your computer and the camera wait a few seconds firmly without forcing plug the cable back in to the camera and the computer caution firewire ports are keyed so the firewire cable can only be inserted one way make sure you are inserting the firewire cable into the firewire port in the correct orientation restart your computer if the green light on top of the isight is not lit turn on the camera by gently twisting the lens launch ichat av if your isight camera continues to function improperly continue on to the steps below see if a different firewire port works some macs have more than one firewire port if your computer has another firewire port disconnect the isight camera from the current port and plug it into the other one restart your computer and test the camera before continuing to step three check to see if other firewire devices work if you have another firewire device such as a video camera or an external hard drive try plugging it into your computer to see if it works if your other firewire devices work this means that your computers firewire port is working correctly if your other firewire devices dont work there may be an issue with your computer contact an apple authorized service provider for assistance determine if there is an incompatibility with another firewire device if more than one firewire device is connected to your computer there may be an incompatibility between two of the devices to rule this out disconnect all other firewire devices from the computer including external hard drives cddvd drives other cameras and firewirebased networking equipment such as hubs and repeaters if your isight camera works normally when you remove other firewire devices plug them back in one at a time to isolate the cause of the issue make sure the firewire cable is good follow these steps to test the firewire cable choose about this mac from the apple menu click more info system profiler opens in the system profiler window click on the devices and volumes option click the disclosure triangle if necessary in the firewire information area information about your isight camera should appear in the firewire information field if you see the isight camera in this field your cable is good once youve confirmed the cable you are using is good use it to plug your isight into your computer if the green light on the top of the camera does not light up immediately within a second there may be an issue with your camera fill out an isight service request to have your camera repaired important do not send your isight camera for repair until you have tried each troubleshooting step if the firewire cable that came with your isight camera didnt work try another firewire cable that you know works if this cable works there is an issue with your isights firewire cable if your camera is in the limited warranty period fill out an isight service request to receive a replacement cable check to see if there is an issue with your camera if information about your isight appears in system profiler but the camera still does not work follow these steps open ichat av choose preferences from the ichat menu click the video button twist the front of the isight camera lens to open the iris barrier the green light on the camera turns on when the iris barrier is open

the y flag tells fsck that you want to answer yes to all questions about fixing repairing or salvaging information this is the optimal approach as answering no to any question causes fsck to stop you cannot determine that all necessary repairs have been made until fsck completes and gives its final report the f flag forces fsck to check filesystems that are marked as clean oct 13 2015

unable to print try printing from this user account if you were unable to connect to the internet try browsing a website from this user account if you were using any specific settings that testing depends on such as using a specific email account or icloud account set up the same account in the test user for email and most other settings you can use the internet accounts pane in system preferences to set up these kinds of accounts if files from your home folder are needed for testing copy them to shared folder in the users folder usersshared after logging in as the test user copy these items to the same location in the test users home folder to test with if an issue happens in only one user accountif performing the same steps in a test user account doesnt result in the same unexpected behavior you most likely dont need to reinstall any apps or os x if an issue only happens in one app check the apps documentation or support website for instructions on troubleshooting specific preference or setting files if you need help with a specific alert message or issue search the apple support website for the text of the alert message youre seeing if an issue happens in more than one user accountif the same unexpected behavior happens in more than one user account on your mac try checking for software or hardware issues after youre doneafter youve finished testing log out of the test account by choosing log out from the apple menu then log in to your original user account you can remove the test user account you created when youre done make sure youre completely finished testing and that you dont need any of the files or settings you created or copied there before you remove it get helpif you need more help with a software or hardware issue contact apple

superdrive apple computers without a builtin optical drive can connect an external apple usb superdrive or macbook air superdrive to read optical media such as cds and dvds the apple usb superdrive has a slightly longer 340mm cable compared to the cable on the macbook air superdrive 250mm both superdrives are functionally equivalent older models of the macbook macbook pro imac mac pro and mac mini computers have a builtin superdrive the superdrive uses a slotloading mechanism which pulls the disc directly in rather than first placing the disc onto a loading tray older mac pro models use a loading tray first steps make sure the apple usb superdrive is lying flat on a surface with the silver top facing upward shown below if the superdrive is oriented upside down it will not read discscorrect aluminum enclosure is facing up incorrect apple logo should be facing down because the usb port on external displays may not be powered at startup connect the drive directly to the usb ports on your apple computer when you need to use the superdrive as a startup device reconnect the superdrive directly to the display when you no longer need to start the computer from the superdrive the apple usb superdrive and macbook air superdrive are designed exclusively for use with mac computers that do not have a builtin optical drive plug in the superdrive directly to the computers usb port dont use a usb hub you can also connect the superdrive to the usb ports on the back of the apple led cinema display 24inch late 2008 apple led cinema display 27inch or apple thunderbolt display be sure not to put the drive underneath anything heavy underneath your computer or on top of your computer if you have trouble using a superdrive with microsoft windows try starting the computer with the superdrive already plugged in check your discbefore troubleshooting first confirm the discs you are using will work with your computer inserting a nonstandard sized or shaped disc into a drive that is not designed to accommodate it may damage the drive use of such discs is not supported and any damage caused will not be covered under your apple warranty or applicable extended service contract the slot loading drives used in apple computers work with only standard 120 mm round discs standard 120 mm round disc example nonstandard sized or shaped discs that are not supported specific troubleshootingbelow are several possible symptoms you may see follow the steps for the appropriate symptom to figure out whether the issue stems from the drive or the media be sure to inspect discs before use to ensure they are not cracked scratched or otherwise damaged inspection should include the inner ring of the disc which should be smooth and burr free a disc with physical defects may become stuck in or cause damage to the drive doesnt accept discs be sure to check your disc to make sure it is flat you can check this by putting the disc upsidedown on a flat surface if the disc is bowed up on any side or in the center do not use the disc because it might get stuck in the drive do not use discs that have anything attached to them or dangling from them such as sweeper or cleaning discs if the drive struggles when you put in a disc or stops partway carefully look at the disc for labels that may be interfering if there arent any raised labels then try putting the disc in a few more times try another disc to see if the issue is being caused by a specific disc make sure you insert the disc far enough for the drive mechanism to activate you need to insert discs nearly all the way before the drive will activate and pull them in if you dont completely insert a disc the drive will reverse and push the disc back out allow the drive one or two seconds to accept the disc while it is fully inserted reset the system management controller smc if the drive repeatedly does not accept discs contact apple or an apple authorized service provider or make an appointment with an apple retail store accepts discs but they dont mount or are automatically ejected make sure the drive is not placed upside down the aluminum enclosure should be facing up as shown in section 1 check the discs surface for scratches and dirt since these things can prevent the disc from appearing on the desktop connect the macbook air superdrive directly to the computers usb port instead a usb hub reset the system management controller smc ensure your drive can read the specific type of disc being used the system profiler or system information may provide additional information regarding what media your computer supports os x snow leopard v106 or earlier open apple system profiler by choosing about this mac from the apple menu then click more info os x lion v107 and later click the apple menu and then hold down the option key choose system information from the menu if the disc continues to not be recognized contact apple or an apple authorized service provider or make an appointment with an apple retail store doesnt eject discs or discs eject slowly if the drive ejects discs slowly or appears to be struggling insert and eject a single disc several times check the disc to see if it has a label or other material stuck to the disc that increases the thickness remove the label if possible if the disc will not eject try pressing the eject key on the keyboard some older keyboards may use the f12 key to eject discs if the disc will not eject try dragging the disc icon to the trash if the disc will still not eject try holding down the trackpad or mouse button after restarting the computer the superdrive should attempt to eject the disc if the disc continues not to eject reset the system management controller smc and try steps 14 again if the disc still does not eject contact apple or an apple authorized service provider or make an appointment with an apple retail store for additional assistance noisy or vibrating drive read more about noises from the optical drive and compare the sample files provided to the noises you are experiencing due to the way optical drives function by rotating the disc rapidly some noise and vibration is expected if after reviewing the article in step 1 the drive appears to be noisy beyond the samples provided when you insert or eject discs try inserting and ejecting a disc several times to correct the issue try other discs to see if the issue can be isolated to a single disc or type of disc as opposed to the drive itself if a disc is weighted unevenly such as discs that have a labels or stickers it can cause additional noise and vibration when spinning up in the drive reset the system management controller smc vibrations due to the optical drive being in use may be exacerbated by using the system on a surface that is not hard and level make sure all the plastic feet on your notebook computer are present as this could create an uneven surface be aware that the drive should only operate horizontally and noise may increase if you try to use it at an angle picking up or moving the machine while a disc is being read may result in the disc becoming unbalanced any damage sustained to the drive or the disc as a result of operating it in this manner is not covered by the products warranty while a certain amount of noise and vibration is expected if you believe the noise or the vibrations being generated by the drive are not normal please contact apple contact an apple authorized service provider or make an appointment with an apple retail store for additional troubleshooting evaluation or service

pro x 1023 and earlier and will not be maintained before you updatewhen you update to final cut pro x 101 1023 your projects and events are updated this article explains how your updated libraries and other files work in these newer versions of final cut pro x updated final cut pro x files cant be used with final cut pro x app versions earlier than 101 before you update create backups of the app and your files in case you need them later you should also complete any active projects before you update if youre using final cut pro x 1009 or earlier and you want to update to final cut pro x 103 you must first update your application to any version between 101 and 1023 you can download and use the 30 day final cut pro x 1023 trial to update your final cut pro x 1009 or earlier projects and events to libraries and then update to final cut pro x 103 about librarieslibraries in final cut pro x 101 1023 contain both projects and events in one place think of libraries as a way to collect and organize related projects and events at a higher level for example you could use a separate library for each of your professional clients or you could use libraries to separate different video productions each of which contains its own projects and events library advantagesbecause a library contains both projects and events it provides a single consolidated location for all your source media and edits you can store libraries on local volumes and xsan volumes its easy to open and close libraries to access the media you need and its simple to move media and projects between libraries how to update your projects and eventswhen you first open final cut pro x 101 1023 youll see a window with these choices update all automatically updates all accessible projects and events and puts them in a separate library for each hard disk projects and events are accessible if they are in the movies folder on your startup volume or at the root level of any mounted volumes to be updated projects and events must also be in the final cut projects and final cut events folders respectively update later postpones updating all of your existing content is unchanged and final cut pro opens with a new empty library that contains no media you can update your projects and events later by choosing file update projects and events locate lets you manually navigate to a connected hard disk folder or san location where projects and events are located for final cut pro x to update them where to find your projects after updatingthe update process creates a new library for each connected volume that contains final cut pro x projects and events then creates an updated projects event in each of those new libraries all of the projects from your project library are collected in these updated projects events which appear at the top of the list of events for each new library in the libraries list if you kept your projects and events on separate volumes they will appear in separate libraries but you can copy or move clips projects or entire events between libraries and hard disks if you have projects and events that are either hidden or not at the top level of your connected volumes you can update them manually in previous versions of final cut pro x projects appeared in the project library in the lowerleft corner of the final cut pro x window in final cut pro x 101 and later projects are contained in events within final cut pro x libraries there is no project library in final cut pro x 101 and later where to find your media after updatingmedia that you stored inside your original event is stored inside your new library media that was linked to an external folder and was not copied inside your original event stays in that external folder and is linked to your new library changes to compound clips and multicam clipscompound clips and multicam clips are reference clips when you modify a reference clip the change is reflected in every instance of that clip when you update an event that contains instances of reference clips on other volumes the reference clips are copied into the new library the copies are independent of the original reference clips this means that changes to the new reference clips dont affect instances of the original clips updating an individual project or event is not necessaryyou dont need to update all the projects and events within any final cut projects or final cut events folder at the same time references to assets compound clips and multicam clips are automatically resolved you can also navigate to a san location on shared storage using the locate command and update everything in that folder at once update projects and events in a san location or folderto update projects and events in a san click the locate button when you first open final cut pro x 101 1023 or choose file update projects and events media isnt duplicated as part of the update processduring the update process final cut pro creates links between the final cut pro 101 1023 library and the media files in your old projects and events if you delete your old project and event files the media files remain in the new final cut pro library if you delete the new final cut pro library the media files remain in your old projects and events by using these links final cut pro does not have to copy media files or use additional disk space deleting old project and event files after updatingwhen you successfully update your projects and events the old projects and events are placed in a folder named library name old final cut projects and events next to the library file on the hard disk you can choose to delete or archive these original files deleting these older project and event files after a successful update does not delete original media library namesthe new libraries created during the update process are labeled with the name of the volume or folder that contains the projects and events additional files created when you update to final cut pro x 101 1023if your projects or events used compound clips or multicam clips from events on other volumes the clips are created again in your new library these files dont contain media so they take up very little space on your drives reorganize material after you updatelibraries provide great flexibility for media management you can create separate libraries for different productions or clients or you can create a separate library for each of your events to create a new library choose file new library copy an event to the new library by dragging it to the new library you can also move an event to a library by choosing file copy to library or file move to library to find out more about updating projects and events see updating your projects and events in final cut pro x help move libraries between drivesyou can copy libraries between hard disks using the finder be sure to quit final cut pro x before moving a library you can store libraries on local volumes and xsan volumes use multiple libraries with the same nameyou can use multiple libraries that have the same name but its a good idea to use different names so you can easily distinguish between libraries if you use the same name for two libraries within the final cut pro x app the second library name is incremented library 1 library 2 and so on in the libraries list if you use the same name for two libraries in the finder both libraries appear with the same name in the libraries list choose your locations for media cache and backupsas of final cut pro x 1012 you can use the library properties inspector to specify media storage locations for each individual library in the media import window you can choose to copy imported media to the library or leave it in its current place you can also specify a custom storage location for imported media this option is in the library properties inspector allowing you to select custom storage locations on a perlibrary basis you can view and define specific storage locations for media cache files render files analysis files thumbnail images and audio waveforms and library backups for each of your libraries you can do this in the library properties inspector store files within the library or in external folders you choose you can also consolidate all files as managed media inside the library for easy transport or archiving for more information about the library properties inspector see manage storage locations in final cut pro x help organizing generated mediawhen you create optimized proxy or rendered media you could store all of those files outside of the library using the library properties inspector you could pick a location for saving media on a drive that is fast enough to play back the files like an xsan volume you can also easily delete this media as needed which makes it faster and simpler to copy move or archive your libraries oct 27 2016

HT204759	identifying fraudulent phishing email learn how to identify fraudulent phishing email phishing also known as carding or spoofing refers to email that attempts to fraudulently acquire personal information from you such as your account password or credit card information on the surface the email may appear to be from a legitimate company or individual but its not as a general rule never send credit card information account passwords or extensive personal information in an email unless you verify that the recipient is who they claim to be many companies have policies that state they will never solicit such information from customers by email if you do receive email that youre not sure is valid here are some tips that can help you determine its legitimacy find out who the email is really fromview the email headers to see where the message really originated from to find out how to view headers in os x mail see this article if youre using icloud mail on the web webmail follow these steps to view the headers a typical email header displays several lines that begin with received note the last received line this line will look something like this received from genericwebsiteorg 123456789101 if the received from information does not match the email address of the sender or the company being represented in the email it usually means that the message did not truly come from that individual or company be cautious of links in the emailnote apple may send email notifications to you containing embedded links to legitimate thirdparty sites when you receive an email with links to other sites use the information below to help you determine whether or not the links are legitimate one common phishing technique is to include links in an email that look like they go to a legitimate website upon closer inspection the link may actually take you to a website that has nothing to do with the company the email is pretending to be from even though the resulting website may be designed to look exactly the same in os x lion and mountain lion mail can help identify these type of links simply mouse over but dont click any link in an email and you will see a popup that shows you the actual url that you will be taken to heres an example you can clearly see that the visible link and the real link do not matchbe careful if the urls in your email do not match or the second url is not from a domain or company you are familiar with this is a good indication that this is a phishing email tip if youre using icloud mail with safari you can mouse over any link and compare the addresses there as well if you have the status bar enabled in your browser mousing over a link will show the url in the browsers status bar at the bottom of the window check that the website youre accessing is legitimateif you think the url is legitimate and you click on the link you can still check that its a trusted website and business modern browsers like safari 5 firefox 7 google chrome and internet explorer 10 display the company name in green if the site has been issued an extended validation ev certificate and is a legitimate websitebusiness the icloud service uses ev certificates just look at the address bar in your web browser when you log in to icloudcom you will see apple inc displayed in green so you know that the site is legitimately apple safari firefox note the email greetingphishing emails tend to start with generic phrases like dear valued customer or your email account name such as dear snookums123 instead of your name dear emily for example most legitimate companies include your name in their correspondence because companies will have it on record if youve dealt with them before the message arrived at a different email address than the one you gave the senderif the sender sent the message to an address that was not the one you provided to the company this is usually a good indication that the message is not legitimate you can usually verify what email address a company has on file on their website just be sure to go to their real website instead of following any links in a suspicious email keep previous history in mindif youve had previous valid correspondence with the company compare those messages to the email in question if you have never done business with a particular company and you receive an email that appears to be from that company requesting account information it could be an attempt at phishing again never email account information or credit card information if you are in doubt never provide personal account information through emailf you receive an unsolicited commercial email requesting personal information do not provide any information without first checking directly with the company that appears to

HT203930	system overload alerts in logic pro x learn how to avoid system overload alerts in logic pro x when working on a logic pro x project with a lot of audio tracks software instruments or plugins a system overload alert might occasionally appear a system overload alert appears when your mac doesnt have enough processing power to play back or record audio use the techniques in this article to keep these alerts from appearing configure your systemfollow these guidelines when configuring your system for use with logic pro quit other apps when using logic pro make sure your mac has the maximum amount of ram especially if your projects usually include many plugins or multiple instances of the exs24 sampler save projects with high track counts to a dedicated hard drive such as a solidstate drive thunderbolt drive or usb 3 drive instead of saving projects to the system drive of your mac if your projects include multiple instances of the exs24 mkii sampler use a dedicated hard drive to store exs24 samples always use a dedicated drive if you use the virtual memory option with exs24 format any hard drives used with logic pro in the mac os extended journaled format also called the hfs plus journaled format monitor system performanceuse the meters in the logic pro cpuhd window to monitor system performance while working on a project to view the cpuhd window choose view customize control bar and display choose custom from the popup menu in the lcd section select the load meters cpuhd checkbox then click ok a cpuhd meter appears on the right side of the lcd doubleclick the cpu meter to open it in a new expanded window the cpuhd window has two sets of meters audio shows the amount of cpu and ram processing power used by logic pro each cpu core in your mac has its own meter on mac computers with processors that support hyperthreading two meters are shown for each core disk io shows the amount of disk bandwidth used by logic pro watch the meters as the project plays back noting when the meters are full when a meter is full the cpu or the disk has reached the limit of its processing capability system overload alerts can appear when any of these meters peak you can use this information to make adjustments to your project or your system configuration set audio device preferenceschoose logic pro x preferences audio click devices then adjust the following preferences io buffer size increase the io buffer size up to a maximum of 256 samples the io buffers temporarily store audio data before sending it to other destinations on your mac increasing the io buffer size reduces the load on the cpu of your mac however larger io buffer sizes increase latency when recording to avoid latency and system overload alerts decrease the io buffer size when recording then increase it when mixing if youre recording audio and not software instruments you can monitor your audio directly from the source choose logic pro x preferences audio general and deselect software monitoring you can then set the io buffer size to 256 samples and leave it there for both recording and mixing process buffer range set this option to large as with the io buffers higher settings increase latency rewire behavior if you arent using rewire then set this option to off if you are using rewire set this option to playback mode multithreading multithreading affects how logic distributes the dsp resources of your mac learn more about setting the multithreading preference to optimize performance set automation preferencesif your project doesnt include automation or the automation doesnt need to be sample accurate you can reduce the cpu load by turning off sample accurate automation choose logic pro x preferences audio and click general from the sample accurate automation popup menu choose off if your project does include automation choose the option that includes only the parameters youre automating choose the best sample rate for your projectprojects with higher sample rates create larger audio files which can increase the load on the cpu and disk plugins also require more cpu power to process audio files at higher sample rates always balance the considerations of audio quality anticipated delivery medium for the final product and the performance of your mac when selecting the sample rate for any project if disk activity is causing system overload alerts try choosing lower sample rates for your projects use send effectswhen using cpuintensive effect plugins such as reverbs and delays you can reduce the load on the cpu by using send effects send effects let you use a single plugin to process signals from multiple channels avoid inserting effect plugins on individual tracks in a project if you need to insert reverb plugins on individual tracks try less cpuintensive reverbs like the silververb and platinumverb optimize software instrumentsuse these guidelines when working with software instruments when mixing make sure to select an audio track or an external midi track not a software instrument track select a software instrument track only when youre actively working on it if your project includes track stacks make sure no software instrument subtracks are selected freeze tracks especially tracks with a lot of plugins however if system overload alerts coincide with peaks in the disk io meter avoid freezing software instrument tracks freezing software instrument tracks can increase the load on the disk increasing the likelihood of encountering a system overload alert set the number of voices used in a software instrument to the lowest number required for example if you have a sculpture track that plays only two simultaneous notes you could set that instance of sculpture to use two voices optimize exs24 mkii virtual memory settingsyou can adjust exs24 mkii virtual memory settings to optimize its performance in the exs24 mkii parameter window click the options button then select virtual memory from the popup menu adjust the following preferences active if most of your system overload alerts coincide with peaks in the cpuhd window audio meter select this option if the alerts coincide with peaks in the disk io meter deselect it disk drive speed if you have a solidstate drive or a 7200rpm or faster hard drive for your audio samples choose fast if you are using a 5400rpm drive for your audio samples choose medium hard disk recording activity if your projects include very few audio tracks select less if your projects include a lot of audio tracks select average or extensive settings in the exs24 virtual memory window are globalthey affect all instances of exs24 in all projects optimize alchemyyou can also optimize alchemy for improved performance jul 6 2016

wireless connections among several wifi base stations or to connect them using ethernet to create a roaming network this article is designed to help you understand what options are available and which is the best option for your environment important note for airport express users if you are considering adding an airport express to your network to stream music or to provide wireless printing you may find this article helpful what is client mode definitionswifi base station any variety of airport extreme base station airport express or time capsule extending a wireless network using multiple wifi base stations wirelessly to extend the range of an airport network over a wider physical area when the range of a single base station is insufficient multi wifi base station network a network that utilizes more than one wifi base station to extend the range of a network or to extend features such as internet access music streaming printing storage etc the wifi base stations may be connected together via ethernet or wirelessly wifi client a wifi client is any device that uses wifi access to the internet printing storage or music streaming client examples include computers ipad iphone game console digital video recorder andor other wifi devices primary base station this is typically the base station that connects to the modem and has the gateway address to the internet it is common for the primary wifi base station to provide the dhcp service for the wifi network extended wifi base station any wifi base station that connects to a primary wifi base station to extend the range of the network unless otherwise indicated extended wifi base stations should be set to use bridge mode throughput the amount of data that is transmitted or received each second measured in megabits per second mbps choosing between single versus multiple wifi base stations before you add additional wifi base stations to your network you should consider whether or not you really need to adding wifi base stations when it is unnecessary can reduce wifi throughput because the wifi network will require more data management overhead the network configuration also becomes more complex in the case of a wirelessly extended network throughput may be reduced to less than 60 percent of that of a single device the general rule is to keep the wifi network as simple as possible you can accomplish this by using the minimum number of wifi base stations required to service the physical network area and by using ethernet wherever possible extending the range of your wifi network by connecting wifi base stations together using ethernet is always the best option and will provide the best throughput ethernet offers up to one gigabit rate which is much faster than wireless for wireless the maximum rate is 450 mbps on 80211n 5 ghz ethernet is also resistant to radio frequency interference and is easier to troubleshoot additionally as there is virtually no management overhead over ethernet more data will move from one point to another in the same space of time given that in some environments a single wifi base station doesnt fulfill your requirements using multiple wifi base stations can improve your network range and throughput in areas farther away from the primary wifi base station consider that the farther away you are or the more obstructions between your wifi client device and the wifi base station such as bathroom tile which the signal must attempt to pass through the weaker the radio signal strength and the lower the throughput assuming that a single base station doesnt fulfill your requirements you should understand the different methods you can employ to extend your wifi network range and choose which of those methods is best for you multiple wifi base station network typeslearn about the types of networks and how to choose between them if you need to extend the range of your wireless network which method should you usefor 80211abgn wifi base stations roaming network recommended wirelessly extended network for 80211g wifi base stations roaming network recommended wds these methods are explained below at the bottom of this article are links to individual articles that explain the set up and configuration for each method wifi base stations will provide an internet connection with client computers wirelessly or through an ethernet connection if the client computers are connected to the base station by ethernet roaming network ethernetconnected wifi base stations for 80211n wifi base stations creating a roaming network is by far the best choice this will provide the best throughput between the base stations and your wifi devices this set up requires that your wifi base stations are connected via ethernet the primary base station provides dhcp services while the extended base station will be configured to use bridge mode all wifi base stations within the roaming network should use the same passwords security type openwepwpa and network name ssid you can add several extended wifi base stations to expand a roaming network you can incorporate a network switch if you dont have enough lan ports available on your primary wifi base station wirelessly extended network 80211nif you are unable to build the recommended roaming network then a wirelessly extended network is the next best option to create a wireless extended network you must place the extended wifi base station within range of the primary wifi base station extended network range considerations in the above example the primary wifi base station is out of wireless range of the extended wifi base station therefore the extended wifi base station cannot join or extend the wireless network the extended wifi base station must be moved to a location that is within wifi range of the primary wifi base station important note if another extended wifi base station is placed between the primary wifi base station and the extended wifi base station the extended wifi base station will not allow clients to join it all extended wifi base stations must be in direct range of the primary wifi base station wds 80211g a wireless distribution system wds is the method used to extend the range of airport extreme 80211abg and airport express 80211abg wifi base stations wds is supported by airport utility 552 or earlier wds allows you to set up each wifi base station in one of three ways wds main primary wifi base station wds relay wds remote a wds main base station is connected to the internet and shares its connection with wds relay and wds remote base stations a wds relay base station shares the main base stations internet connection and will also relay the connection to wds remote base stations a wds remote base station simply shares the wds main base stations internet connection either directly if in direct range or through a wds relay all three base station configurations wds main wds remote and wds relay can share the wds main wifi base stations internet connection with client computers wirelessly or through an ethernet connection if the client computers are connected to the base station by ethernet when you set up base stations in a wds you need to know the airport id of each base station the airport id also known as the media access controller mac address is printed on the label on the bottom of the airport extreme base station next to the airport symbol and on the power adapter side of the airport express base station note as a relay the wifi base station must receive the data from one wifi base station repackage it send it to the other wifi base station and vice versa this method effectively cuts the throughput by more than half an 80211abg wifi base station should only be used in this manner in areas where there is no other option and where higher throughput is not essential steps to add wifi base stations to your airport networkfor specific instructions on extending the range of your preferred network
